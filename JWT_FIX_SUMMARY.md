# JWT Public Key Processing Error Fix Summary

## Branch: `fix-jwt-public-key-errors`

## Problem
The application was experiencing "Failed to process public key" errors when users (both free tier and premium tier) tried to log in or perform authenticated actions. The errors manifested as:
- 500 errors on `/api/user-status` endpoint
- "Failed to fetch user status: 500" in the browser console
- "Failed to process public key" error messages

## Root Cause
The JWT verification system was failing because:
1. The JWKS client initialization was happening only once at startup
2. If the initialization failed (network issues, temporary AWS service unavailability), there was no retry mechanism
3. The fallback JWT verification was also failing when trying to fetch the JWKS data
4. No caching mechanism for JWKS data, causing excessive network calls

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Lazy Initialization with Retry Logic
- Created `get_or_initialize_jwks_client()` function that:
  - Checks if JWKS client exists and returns it if available
  - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
  - Tests the client after initialization to ensure it's working

### 2. JWKS Data Caching
- Implemented JWKS data caching with 1-hour expiration
- Reduces network calls to AWS Cognito
- Provides fallback data if network is temporarily unavailable

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages that specifically mention "Failed to process public key"
- Separate handling for network errors vs. key not found errors
- More graceful fallback between PyJWT and python-jose libraries

### 4. Enhanced Health Check
- Added JWT configuration status to `/api/health` endpoint
- Shows JWKS client availability and cache status
- Helps with debugging JWT issues in production

### 5. Additional Improvements
- Added more detailed logging in user-status endpoint
- Fixed missing `time` module import
- Version bumped to `v0.7.1-jwt-fix`

## Testing the Fix
After deploying via GitHub Actions:

1. Test the health endpoint to verify JWT configuration:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-backend-url/api/health
   ```

2. Check for proper JWT status in the response:
   ```json
   {
     "jwt_status": "configured",
     "jwt_details": {
       "jwks_client_available": true,
       "jwks_cache_available": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. Test login functionality for both free and premium tier users

## Deployment Instructions
1. Create a PR from `fix-jwt-public-key-errors` branch to `main`
2. Merge the PR after review
3. Run GitHub Actions workflows:
   - Deploy Backend
   - Deploy Frontend

## Expected Results
- No more "Failed to process public key" errors
- Successful authentication for all user tiers
- More resilient JWT verification with automatic retries
- Better debugging information in health checks
