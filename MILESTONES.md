# FileShare Plus - Development Milestones

## Milestone 1: Core MVP Complete ✅ (July 4, 2025)

### 🎯 Objective
Deliver a working file sharing application with user authentication, se## Next Milestone: Production Readiness & Monetization (Planned)
- **Payment Integration**: Implement actual Premium paywall with Stripe/AWS Billing
- **Advanced Premium Features**: File sharing, bulk operations, analytics dashboard
- **Performance Optimization**: CDN improvements, caching strategies, load testing
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: CloudWatch dashboards, error tracking, uptime monitoring
- **Security Hardening**: Penetration testing, compliance audit, rate limiting
- **Production Deployment**: Blue-green deployment, automated rollback, health checksloads, and reliable downloads.

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Authentication & Security
- AWS Cognito integration with email-based usernames
- Auto-confirmation Lambda trigger for dev environment  
- JWT token validation in backend
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- User isolation with individual S3 folders (`{user_id}/{filename}`)

#### File Operations
- **Upload**: Secure file upload to user-specific S3 directories
- **Download**: Presigned URL generation with tiered expiration (3 days free, 30 days premium)
- **Special Characters**: Robust handling of filenames with `&`, quotes, brackets, etc.
- **File Sanitization**: Automatic replacement of problematic characters for S3 compatibility

#### Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) → CloudFront → S3 static hosting
- **Backend**: Flask → ECS Fargate → Application Load Balancer
- **Storage**: S3 with separate buckets for frontend and file uploads
- **Networking**: VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway
- **Deployment**: Terraform modules for dev environment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment

### 🔧 Technical Solutions Implemented

#### File Name Handling
**Problem**: Files with `&` character caused download failures due to URL parameter parsing issues.

**Solution**: 
- Backend sanitizes filenames on upload (`sanitize_filename()` function)
- Frontend uses `encodeURIComponent()` for URL encoding
- Backend uses `urllib.parse.unquote()` for decoding
- Special characters replaced with `-` for S3 storage

#### Authentication Flow
**Problem**: JWT validation and Cognito integration complexity.

**Solution**:
- Simplified JWT validation to signature-only verification
- Added comprehensive debug logging for token inspection
- Environment variable management through ECS task definitions
- Auto-confirmation Lambda for seamless dev experience

#### Infrastructure Reliability
**Problem**: Complex multi-service deployment coordination.

**Solution**:
- Modular Terraform structure (network, frontend, backend, cognito)
- GitHub Actions workflows with proper dependency management
- ECS service deployment with health checks
- CloudWatch logging for debugging

### 📊 Current Status
```
User Registration  ✅ Working
User Login         ✅ Working  
File Upload        ✅ Working
File Download      ✅ Working (with special characters)
User Isolation     ✅ Working
Tier System        ✅ Working
Infrastructure     ✅ Deployed and stable
CI/CD Pipeline     ✅ Working
```

### 🐛 Issues Resolved
1. **Download link truncation** - Files with `&` character were being truncated
2. **JWT validation errors** - Overly complex validation causing failures
3. **CORS issues** - Frontend couldn't communicate with backend
4. **Environment variables** - Missing `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` in ECS
5. **URL encoding** - Special characters breaking download URLs
6. **User folder structure** - Files not being stored in user-specific directories

### 🎯 Success Metrics
- ✅ End-to-end file upload and download working
- ✅ User authentication and authorization functional
- ✅ Infrastructure deployable via Terraform
- ✅ Special character handling robust
- ✅ Zero manual intervention required for core workflows

### 🚀 Lessons Learned
1. **Start Simple**: Complex solutions (POST requests, base64 encoding) often introduce more problems
2. **Systematic Approach**: Fixing one issue at a time is more efficient than multiple simultaneous changes
3. **Standard Libraries**: Using proven encoding methods (`encodeURIComponent`/`unquote`) over custom solutions
4. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging was crucial for identifying root causes
5. **Infrastructure First**: Ensuring stable infrastructure before debugging application issues

## v0.6.1: Email Link Issue Identified & URL Shortening Planning (July 6, 2025)

### 🔍 Issue Discovery
During testing of the Premium File Explorer's Email Link feature, discovered that the mailto protocol fails with long URLs:

- **Problem**: CloudFront download URLs (~1500+ characters) exceed mailto URL length limits
- **Testing**: Simple mailto works fine, but complex URLs with long CloudFront paths fail
- **Impact**: Both free tier and Premium Email Link buttons don't open email clients
- **Root Cause**: Most browsers/email clients have ~2000 character limits for mailto URLs

### 📋 URL Shortening Solution Planned
**Selected Approach**: Internal URL Shortener (Option 1)
- **Backend**: New `/api/shorten` and `/s/{code}` endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) / RDS (prod) for URL mappings
- **Format**: `cf.aws.lupan.ca/s/abc123` (6-character base62 codes)
- **Features**: Click tracking, expiration handling, analytics ready
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing file upload/download flow

### 🎯 Current Workaround
Users can still share files using:
1. **Copy Link** button → paste manually into email
2. **Direct download** links work perfectly
3. **All other features** remain fully functional
