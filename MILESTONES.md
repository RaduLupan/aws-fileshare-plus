# FileShare Plus - Development Milestones

## Milestone 1: Core MVP Complete ‚úÖ (July 4, 2025)

### üéØ Objective
Deliver a working file sharing application with user authentication, secure uploads, and reliable downloads.

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Authentication & Security
- AWS Cognito integration with email-based usernames
- Auto-confirmation Lambda trigger for dev environment  
- JWT token validation in backend
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- User isolation with individual S3 folders (`{user_id}/{filename}`)

#### File Operations
- **Upload**: Secure file upload to user-specific S3 directories
- **Download**: Presigned URL generation with tiered expiration (3 days free, 30 days premium)
- **Special Characters**: Robust handling of filenames with `&`, quotes, brackets, etc.
- **File Sanitization**: Automatic replacement of problematic characters for S3 compatibility

#### Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) ‚Üí CloudFront ‚Üí S3 static hosting
- **Backend**: Flask ‚Üí ECS Fargate ‚Üí Application Load Balancer
- **Storage**: S3 with separate buckets for frontend and file uploads
- **Networking**: VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway
- **Deployment**: Terraform modules for dev environment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment

### üîß Technical Solutions Implemented

#### File Name Handling
**Problem**: Files with `&` character caused download failures due to URL parameter parsing issues.

**Solution**: 
- Backend sanitizes filenames on upload (`sanitize_filename()` function)
- Frontend uses `encodeURIComponent()` for URL encoding
- Backend uses `urllib.parse.unquote()` for decoding
- Special characters replaced with `-` for S3 storage

#### Authentication Flow
**Problem**: JWT validation and Cognito integration complexity.

**Solution**:
- Simplified JWT validation to signature-only verification
- Added comprehensive debug logging for token inspection
- Environment variable management through ECS task definitions
- Auto-confirmation Lambda for seamless dev experience

#### Infrastructure Reliability
**Problem**: Complex multi-service deployment coordination.

**Solution**:
- Modular Terraform structure (network, frontend, backend, cognito)
- GitHub Actions workflows with proper dependency management
- ECS service deployment with health checks
- CloudWatch logging for debugging

### üìä Current Status
```
User Registration  ‚úÖ Working
User Login         ‚úÖ Working  
File Upload        ‚úÖ Working
File Download      ‚úÖ Working (with special characters)
User Isolation     ‚úÖ Working
Tier System        ‚úÖ Working
Infrastructure     ‚úÖ Deployed and stable
CI/CD Pipeline     ‚úÖ Working
```

### üêõ Issues Resolved
1. **Download link truncation** - Files with `&` character were being truncated
2. **JWT validation errors** - Overly complex validation causing failures
3. **CORS issues** - Frontend couldn't communicate with backend
4. **Environment variables** - Missing `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` in ECS
5. **URL encoding** - Special characters breaking download URLs
6. **User folder structure** - Files not being stored in user-specific directories

### üéØ Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ End-to-end file upload and download working
- ‚úÖ User authentication and authorization functional
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure deployable via Terraform
- ‚úÖ Special character handling robust
- ‚úÖ Zero manual intervention required for core workflows

### üöÄ Lessons Learned
1. **Start Simple**: Complex solutions (POST requests, base64 encoding) often introduce more problems
2. **Systematic Approach**: Fixing one issue at a time is more efficient than multiple simultaneous changes
3. **Standard Libraries**: Using proven encoding methods (`encodeURIComponent`/`unquote`) over custom solutions
4. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging was crucial for identifying root causes
5. **Infrastructure First**: Ensuring stable infrastructure before debugging application issues

## Next Milestone: Production Readiness (Planned)
- Remove debug logging
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement file upload progress indicators
- Add CloudWatch monitoring and alerts
- Performance optimization and load testing
- Security audit and penetration testing
