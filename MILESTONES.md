# FileShare Plus - Development Milestones

## Milestone 1: Core MVP Complete ✅ (July 4, 2025)

### 🎯 Objective
Deliver a working file sharing application with user authentication, se## Next Milestone: Production Readiness & Monetization (Planned)
- **Payment Integration**: Implement actual Premium paywall with Stripe/AWS Billing
- **Advanced Premium Features**: File sharing, bulk operations, analytics dashboard
- **Performance Optimization**: CDN improvements, caching strategies, load testing
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: CloudWatch dashboards, error tracking, uptime monitoring
- **Security Hardening**: Penetration testing, compliance audit, rate limiting
- **Production Deployment**: Blue-green deployment, automated rollback, health checksloads, and reliable downloads.

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Authentication & Security
- AWS Cognito integration with email-based usernames
- Auto-confirmation Lambda trigger for dev environment  
- JWT token validation in backend
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- User isolation with individual S3 folders (`{user_id}/{filename}`)

#### File Operations
- **Upload**: Secure file upload to user-specific S3 directories
- **Download**: Presigned URL generation with tiered expiration (3 days free, 30 days premium)
- **Special Characters**: Robust handling of filenames with `&`, quotes, brackets, etc.
- **File Sanitization**: Automatic replacement of problematic characters for S3 compatibility

#### Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: React (Vite) → CloudFront → S3 static hosting
- **Backend**: Flask → ECS Fargate → Application Load Balancer
- **Storage**: S3 with separate buckets for frontend and file uploads
- **Networking**: VPC with public/private subnets, NAT Gateway
- **Deployment**: Terraform modules for dev environment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment

### 🔧 Technical Solutions Implemented

#### File Name Handling
**Problem**: Files with `&` character caused download failures due to URL parameter parsing issues.

**Solution**: 
- Backend sanitizes filenames on upload (`sanitize_filename()` function)
- Frontend uses `encodeURIComponent()` for URL encoding
- Backend uses `urllib.parse.unquote()` for decoding
- Special characters replaced with `-` for S3 storage

#### Authentication Flow
**Problem**: JWT validation and Cognito integration complexity.

**Solution**:
- Simplified JWT validation to signature-only verification
- Added comprehensive debug logging for token inspection
- Environment variable management through ECS task definitions
- Auto-confirmation Lambda for seamless dev experience

#### Infrastructure Reliability
**Problem**: Complex multi-service deployment coordination.

**Solution**:
- Modular Terraform structure (network, frontend, backend, cognito)
- GitHub Actions workflows with proper dependency management
- ECS service deployment with health checks
- CloudWatch logging for debugging

### 📊 Current Status
```
User Registration  ✅ Working
User Login         ✅ Working  
File Upload        ✅ Working
File Download      ✅ Working (with special characters)
User Isolation     ✅ Working
Tier System        ✅ Working
Infrastructure     ✅ Deployed and stable
CI/CD Pipeline     ✅ Working
```

### 🐛 Issues Resolved
1. **Download link truncation** - Files with `&` character were being truncated
2. **JWT validation errors** - Overly complex validation causing failures
3. **CORS issues** - Frontend couldn't communicate with backend
4. **Environment variables** - Missing `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` in ECS
5. **URL encoding** - Special characters breaking download URLs
6. **User folder structure** - Files not being stored in user-specific directories

### 🎯 Success Metrics
- ✅ End-to-end file upload and download working
- ✅ User authentication and authorization functional
- ✅ Infrastructure deployable via Terraform
- ✅ Special character handling robust
- ✅ Zero manual intervention required for core workflows

### 🚀 Lessons Learned
1. **Start Simple**: Complex solutions (POST requests, base64 encoding) often introduce more problems
2. **Systematic Approach**: Fixing one issue at a time is more efficient than multiple simultaneous changes
3. **Standard Libraries**: Using proven encoding methods (`encodeURIComponent`/`unquote`) over custom solutions
4. **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging was crucial for identifying root causes
5. **Infrastructure First**: Ensuring stable infrastructure before debugging application issues

## Milestone 2: Premium File Explorer & Email Integration ✅ (July 6, 2025)

### 🎯 Objective
Implement comprehensive file management system for Premium users with professional email delivery.

### ✅ Completed Features

#### Premium File Management
- **File Explorer Interface**: Dedicated UI for Premium users to manage their files
- **File Listing**: Display all uploaded files with metadata (size, upload date, download link expiry)
- **Link Renewal**: Generate new download links for existing files (up to 7-day expiry limit)
- **File Deletion**: Permanently remove files from S3 storage
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh functionality to sync latest file status
- **Access Control**: Premium-only features with automatic free upgrades for testing

#### Email & Communication
- **Custom Domain Email**: SES integration with professional email delivery
- **DNS Automation**: Route 53 automatic DNS record creation for domain verification
- **Password Reset Flow**: Complete forgot password functionality with email verification
- **Email Templates**: Professional email templates for password reset and notifications

#### Infrastructure Improvements
- **Email-based Storage**: Changed S3 folder structure from GUID to `user@email.com/filename`
- **S3 Lifecycle Management**: Configurable automatic file deletion (default: 30 days)
- **Clean Break Migration**: Fresh folder structure without legacy data migration complexity
- **Enhanced Security**: Improved tier-based access control and validation

### 🔧 Backend API Enhancements

#### New Premium Endpoints
```
GET /premium/files           - List all user files with metadata
POST /premium/generate-link  - Generate new download link for existing file
DELETE /premium/delete-file  - Permanently delete file from S3
```

#### Technical Improvements
- **Presigned URL Optimization**: Proper expiration handling (max 7 days for Premium)
- **File Metadata**: Enhanced file information including size and timestamps
